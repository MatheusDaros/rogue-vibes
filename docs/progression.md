# Game Phases and Progression

The game is divided into phases that mirror the growth of a real startup. Each phase introduces new challenges, encounter types, and opportunities ([see game-design.md](./game-design.md)).

## Phases
- **Ideation:** Define product vision and initial approach
- **MVP:** Build your first product, find early users
- **Growth:** Scale product, team, and secure funding
- **Maturity:** Optimize for profit or continued growth
- **Exit:** IPO, acquisition, or sustainability

Each phase unlocks new encounter types and raises the stakes. Progression through these phases is tracked and can unlock [achievements](./achievements.md).

## Progression Metrics
- Product Traction
- Product-Market Fit (PMF)
- Revenue
- Valuation
- Innovation

Your final score is based on these metrics and is used to unlock meta-progression ([see achievements.md](./achievements.md)).
